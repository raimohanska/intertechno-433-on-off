# intertechno-433-on-off

Intertechno 433Mhz outlet on/off tester for Arduino.

It seems that [rc-switch](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch) doesn't support these newer Intertechno outlets
so I had to do some hacking by myself. This is a simple Arduino tester that assumes you've got a 433MHz transmitter
on GPIO pin 10.
